    <h1>The best motherfucking website</h1>
    <span>For real.</span>
    <h2>Styling?</h2>
    <span
      >You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You
      think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some
      award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is
      gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</span

    <p>
      Well, guess what, you're <a href style="color: red">WRONG</a>,
      motherfucker.
    </p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>
      Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of
      the past <span style="color: red"> motherfucking-websites</span>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB
        cat picture below is removed)
      </li>
      <li>
        The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" style="color: #730000"
          >Google home page</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32
        Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)
      </li>
      <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
      <li>
        Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem
        <span style="font-size: 0.4em">well, kind of</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" style="color: #730000"
          >accessible</a
        >, so everyone can enjoy it
        <span style="font-size: 0.4em"
          >but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and
        it also has a cleanish style without looking like an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" style="color: #730000"
          >ARPANET</a
        >
        website
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people
        who still use
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"
          style="color: #730000"
          >IPoAC</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called
        "Open Sans"
        <span style="font-size: 0.4em">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking
        styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is
        proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
      </li>
      <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
      <li>
        Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT</i>.
      </li>
      <li>Use some fucking colors.</li>
      <li>
        Links don't really need to keep that
        <span style="color: blue">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them:
        nor that <span style="color: purple">vio-letish</span> color when they
        are marked as visited. Just give them a
        <span style="color: #00a2e7">nice color</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <span
      >This website is even better than the last
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" style="color: #730000"
        >guy</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" style="color: #730000"
        >guy before him</a
      >.</span
    >
    <span>Why?</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's over a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" style="color: #00a2e7"
          >secure connection</a
        >
        - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be
        different for everyone, pshht!).
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses one of the most general
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTLD" style="color: #00a2e7"
          >gTLDs</a
        >
        available out there: .website
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out
        <a href="https://domainr.com/" style="color: #00a2e7">domainr</a> to do
        something cool too.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the kickass
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" style="color: #00a2e7"
          >Let's Encrypt</a
        >
        CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses
        <a
          href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
          style="color: #00a2e7"
          >a custom version</a
        >
        of the awesome
        <a href="https://jquery.com/" style="color: #00a2e7"
          >ultra-lightweight jQuery</a
        >
        <b>/s</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best
        thing - if the user's browser is outdated they will notice and maybe
        they will switch from
        <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">the crap they use</a> to
        <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">a much cooler browser</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript JavaScript logo, CSS3
        CSS3 logo and HTML5 HTML5 Logo
      </li>
      <li>
        Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the
        website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered
      </li>
      <li>It supports <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">HTTP/2</a></li>
      <li>
        It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious
        bandwidth if you visit the website more than once
      </li>
      <li>
        It allows universal access from every website via
        <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">CORS</a>
      </li>
      <li>It is <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">Accessible</a></li>
      <li>
        It is hosted on <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">GitHub Pages</a>,
        making it <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">almost free</a> to keep this
        website alive
      </li>
      <li>
        It's Open Source, freely available on
        <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7">GitHub</a>, and everybody can
        contribute to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the
        <a href="" style="color: #00a2e7"
          >WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a
        >, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
      </li>

      <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
      <p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>
      <p>
        We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a
        <a href="" style="color: red">motherfuckingwebsite</a>.
